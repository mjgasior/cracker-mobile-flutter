_"Crack Krak√≥w with the Cracker app!"_

Big thanks to :octocat: [mmBs](https://github.com/mmBs) for time and advice. :clap:

## Setup:

If you plan to edit the localization files present in `lib/l10n` which are of ARB  ([Application Resource Bundle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43082804/l10n-arb-file-format)) format, it would be a good idea to get a special IDE plugin which understands how to format such files.

0. Before running the app you will need [Google Maps API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. After you get it, go to `android` directory and find the autogenerated `local.properties` file.
2. Add a new line with your API key in a format like this `google.mapsApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY`.

## Packages:

- `flutter_appauth` - a well-maintained wrapper package around AppAuth for Flutter developed by Michael Bui. AppAuth authenticates and authorizes users and supports the PKCE extension
- `flutter_localizations` - package that specifies additional `MaterialApp` properties that include localization
- `flutter_secure_storage` - library to securely persist data locally
- `geolocator` - geolocation plugin which provides easy access to platform specific location services (FusedLocationProviderClient or if not available the LocationManager on Android and CLLocationManager on iOS)
- `google_maps_flutter` - plugin that provides a Google Maps widget
- `graphql-flutter` - a package based on Apollo GraphQL client that allows an integration with a GraphQL server in Flutter
- `http` - a composable, Future-based library for making HTTP requests published by the Dart Team
