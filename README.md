_"Crack Kraków with the Cracker app!"_

Big thanks to :octocat: [mmBs](https://github.com/mmBs) for time and advice. :clap:

## Setup:

If you plan to edit the localization files present in `lib/l10n` which are of ARB  ([Application Resource Bundle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43082804/l10n-arb-file-format)) format, it would be a good idea to get a special IDE plugin which understands how to format such files.

0. Before running the app you will need [Google Maps API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. After you get it, go to `android` directory and find the autogenerated `local.properties` file.
2. Add a new line with your API key in a format like this `google.mapsApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY`.

## Release:

0. Remember to turn off your emulator before you start the installation on a mobile device.
1. To release the app for Android device just run `flutter build apk --release`.
2. The `apk` file should be present in `cracker-mobile-flutter\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk` directory with the `app-release.apk` name.
2. Download the [SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) from Android Developers website. It includes the `adb` tool, that is Android Debug Bridge. [Extract the contents](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) of this ZIP file into an easily accessible folder (such as `C:\adb`).
3. Turn on the USB debug mode on you phone. Usually you can start with tapping multiple times on the version in settings section, what unlocks the `{} Developer options` section. There you can find an switch which will allow USB debugging.
4. Open Powershell, Git Shell or any of those in the directory where the `adb.exe` is and run `./adb.exe devices`. Your device should be listed.
5. Copy the `.apk` file to the directory where the `adb.exe` file is and run `./adb.exe install app-release.apk`.
6. After the `adb` console returns a message as below, the app should be available on your phone:

```
PS C:\android\platform-tools> .\adb.exe install cracker.apk
Performing Streamed Install
Success
```
