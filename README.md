## Getting Started

Before running the app you will need [Google Maps API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
After you get it, go to `android` directory and find the autogenerated `local.properties` file.
Add a new line with your API key in a format like this `google.mapsApiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"`.
